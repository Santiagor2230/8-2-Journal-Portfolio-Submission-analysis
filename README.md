## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company that wants to develop a website that will allow for their clients to acquired the neccesary knowledge in order to pass the DMV examinations. The client is DriverPass and its owner is Liam, the system that the company wants the team to desgin is a secure interactive website that applys the neccesary authentications and attributes that will allow for cleints to take online classes which will help their clients pass the writing examination for the dmv. Additionally, the company will want their customer to be able to update their appointments of driving pratices as well as check the status of their accounts based on how well they were at taking the practice exams. 

## What did you do particularly well?

The part that I felt that I did particularly well is explaining the software through the UML diagrams which basically will shows the workflow and the inner system of the project and understanding every diagram that will make it possible to potray the DriverPass software, it is always important to understand how to apply building the software through the means of blueprints that illustrate the process to achiving a proper software. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I feel like the documents that I will revise to make sure to implement some improvements will be my sequential diagram because even thou I apply a resonable understanding sequential diagram I felt later on that I was missing something that I should have apply the first time I build the sequential diagram.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpret the user's needs by writing down every aspect of the project that the user needed and I will mostly do this by understanding the important aspect to the least important of the project and in this way it was easier to fully explain more of one aspect compared to the others. I implemented in the system by applying mostly the important aspects of the clients needs through the diagrams and not worrying too much about the least important aspect which can later be implemented as an add on. It is important to consider the user's need when designing because at the end of the day you will want the user to be satified with the work that is being apply to their company so making sure that every aspect of the software is balanced to what the user wants is essential to making a possible perfect project through the user's perspective.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The straties or techniques that I will use to approach designing software that I will eventually apply to future systems will first be to collect data that is needed in order to build the software, then I will use the neccesary tools to organized this particular data and in this case it will be by using the UML diagrams, later use the proper steps to implement the organized data into a functional system. finally comes the software, testing and making sure that every aspect of the system fully satisfied the user's needs.
